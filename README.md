**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Current Participants

## Contributors

- Anyone who wants to contribute
- The whole [OceanProtocol Team](https://github.com/orgs/oceanprotocol/people)

## Maintainers

Everyone with the ability to merge pull requests. Today that is mainly OceanProtocol employees.

In the future, we can add more people who are not OceanProtocol employees as maintainers.

Some people have specializations:

- MarketPlaces: @mikera
- Simulator [Aquarium]: @mikera
- Research [Nautilus]: @diminator, @trentmc
- Core [Tethys]: @aaitor

## Administrators (Founders and Others)

- Mike - @mikera
- Aitor - @aaitor
- Ahmed - @aabdulwahed
- Don - @dgossen
- Dimi - @diminator
- Trent - @trentmc

Note: Administrators serve limited terms of six months or less. That's the idea, anyway.

# OceanProtocol Enhancement Proposals (OEPs)

This is the OceanProtocol Enhancement Proposal project. We collect OEPs for APIs, protocols, and processes.

The process to add or change a OEP is the following:
- A OEP is created and modified by pull requests according to [C4](./1).
- OEP lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [COSS](./2).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./2#raw-oeps) and [Draft](./2#draft-oeps) specifications.

## Abstract

The SONAR OEP is any software, protocol or interaction that allows actors
to publish and discover assets such as data sets, algorithms, infrastructure and so on.

This OEP does not focus on metadata structure, staking or curation. 
It's purely the mechanics of publishing and retrieval of assets.
Optionally this might contain a basic framework for the actor registry without the identity platform. 

## Motivation

Ocean network aims to power marketplaces for relevant AI-related data services. 
The data services require to be discoverable and queryable, as well as consumable.
